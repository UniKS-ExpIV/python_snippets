# AGE pyTopics Test Repository

Possible structure of a repository to save and distribute Python code snippets of the AGE group.

# Structure of this Readme

In this readme, everyone can list the issues that she/he has solved using Python.

The Python code itself can be given as simple code snippets. A complete API definition is not required! But please consider contributing MWEs (minimal working example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example), if possible, so others can run your code rather conveniently.

Please create a folder for every individual issue solved to minimize confusion.
